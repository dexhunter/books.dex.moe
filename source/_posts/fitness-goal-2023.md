So I am reading watching the youtube series on how to lose weight, both in Chinese and English. And I decided to document a bit and create some new year resolutions.

### How to lose the weight

The key point is to create **caloric deficit** which means caloric expend should be more than cloric intake.

### Metabolism

* current personal metrics (12/27/2022)
    * height: 172cm (5'7 feet)
    * weight: 85kg (187.4 pounds)
    * age: 28
* calculated metrics
    * bmi: 28.7
    * basal metabolism: 67+13.73\*85+5\*172-6.9*28=1900.85 kcal
    * calorie expenditure: 1900\*1.6=3040 kcal
* expected total caloric intake
    * protein 85*2=170g
        * egg: 73 kcal, 7 g protein per ( ~5 eggs per day, 350 kcal, 35g protein)
        * milk: 166 kcal, 8 g protein per 250ml (~500ml per day, 300 kcal, 16g protein)
    * carbs 
        * rice: 232 kcal, 52 g carbs per fist (~5 fists per day if only rice, 1250 kcal, 250 g carbs)
        * fruits: 80 kcal, 20 g carbs per fist (~1 fist per day, 80 kcal, 20 g carbs)
    * fat
        * nuts: 114 kcal 10 g fat for 10 pieces small nuts
    * DO NOT
        * do NOT eat: noodle, porridge, banana, durian, avocado, coconut meat, perserved fruit, juice
        * do NOT consume during non-exercise time: bread, energy drink
        * do NOT eat: fat, animal skin, fried food, snack

### What to do?

* food
    * calcualte what is total caloric intake to be expected then intake enough protein, then the rest should be assigned to carbs and fat
    * low calorie density foods: water & vegetables
    * food recipe reference:
        * 3.5 fists lean meat
        * 250ml milk/soy milk
        * 2 full eggs
        * 1 cup of protein whey
        * 4 fists of vegetables
        * 2 L plain water

        * 1 fist fruit
        * 10 pieces small nut
        * 1 slice of bread before exercising
    * eat meal replacements only at night or when you want some snacks
    * lose fat not muscle
    * when bmi too high, it's easy to lose a lot of weight in a short period of time
    * but when bmi gets lower, we should focus on the muscle-fat ratio, and check the wasit, essentially you should look good
* gym exercise
    * strength training + HIIT

        * HIIT （划船机间歇组）15秒冲刺，45秒缓慢， 10次循环，20组
        * 拉伸
    * plan B (chest day)
        * 杠铃卧推
        * T杆推肩
        * 上斜俯身划船

    1. 每天站够两小时
    2. 每天散步两次，每次半小时
