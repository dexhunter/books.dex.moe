A book by Ted Chiang.

This book was recommend by a girl I loved. Although we separated eventually, this book serves as a token of our relationship. Both of us have watched the movie *Arrival* and she really liked the movie. Then I read the book as she told me to. And I liked the writing.

Probably because Ted is also from computer science background, I felt resonating with the way of narrative. IHMO, a speaker of `time` already knows future as everything is already determined.

However, I am happy that future awaits, a lot can happen still.
