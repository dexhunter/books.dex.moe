This is the first book I have read through in English. This is a self-indulgent progress. I faced my inconfidence without any hint of self-pity. The author writes this book in a fun and amusing way, which makes it easy to understand. The experiments seem unconvincing to me because every human being is different and even with massive amount people could only have a tendency to behave in someway. Therefore, I wonder people in different backgrounds will have same irrational behavior. However, another issue I was considering is about FREE!. Undoubtedly, FREE! makes people crazy. But in a mathematical way to analyze, the previous price divided by zero will give an answer of infinity. While if we reduce the price of another more expensive product with the same decreasement, we still get a finite number. Therefore, FREE! is not like something on discount.

Above all, this book is a decent book for reading.
