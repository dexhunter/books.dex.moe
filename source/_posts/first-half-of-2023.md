It has been a while since I wrote anything. Many things happened in life and I am grateful. I have so many things to do each day. The biggest news is that I'm getting married (yes!) and I cohabit with my girlfirend for two months now and we feel we are so matched that we want to live together forever.

Besides the major life event, I also got invited by a friend to join his team on creating a web app with chatGPT to revise papers. Although there are many obstacles, I am learning new thigns every day and the journey has been fulfilling. I agree that LLM is the next big thing in next 5 years and I also want to participate or make my contributions towards the era of Artificial General Intelligence(AGI).

For the [fitness goal](./fitness-goal-2023.md) I posted earlier I think I achieved the most of it and my girlfriend/wife is satisfied about my performance (*wink wink*). I'm continuing my remote work and investments, meanwhile, I am checking the information about moving to another country since both my wife and I want to born our children in a developed country. So I am working hard to make all our goals realized and surely make the world a better place.
